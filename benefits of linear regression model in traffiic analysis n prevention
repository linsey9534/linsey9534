Determining correlation: 
Linear regression helps determine the relationship between different variables and the number of road accidents.. For example, you can use it to analyze the correlation between factors such as road conditions, weather, vehicle age, and traffic density  with accident rates.. By quantifying these relationships, you can prioritize interventions.. 
Predicting accident trends: 
Linear regression can be used to predict accident trends based on historical data.. This predictive capability can help local governments and organizations predict peak accident periods (for example, during rainy seasons or holidays) and allocate resources accordingly.. 
Identify risk factors: 
Using regression analysis, you can determine which factors contribute  most to traffic accidents.. This information is valuable for prioritizing prevention efforts.. In less developed countries,  inadequate road infrastructure, uncontrolled traffic or old vehicles can contribute significantly to accidents.. 
Resource allocation: 
By understanding the influence of different variables on accidents, authorities can allocate resources more effectively.. For example, if  analysis shows that accidents are strongly correlated with road quality, authorities can prioritize road maintenance and improvement..
